My information's right there. But you haven't contacted me yet. What're you waiting for?</p><p>Alright, I get it. There's a lot of engineers and you need me to prove that I can sling some code. I hate to be <strong><i>that guy</i></strong>. I don't like giving the hard sell. It's not my style, I'm typically more laid back. But here's a few things that I'm proud of.</p><p>You ever heard of the site <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>? Don't lie. I know you have. And if so, you've certainly been using my code. I helped build the navigation bar at the top of every page. And when I was on that team in 2016, the A/B tests we ran resulted an increase in revenue of more than $600M <i>per year</i>. Not bad, am I right?</p><img class="max-w-full mb-6" src="/content/assets/amazon-nav.png" alt="Amazon navigation"><p>And you know that talking cylinder that you keep in your house? Yeah, she goes by Alexa usually. Ever asked her for the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html">news </a>? That's running my code too. I taught Alexa many talents. I taught her to recognize the names of your favorite news channels (For example, <i>"Alexa, play news from CNN"</i> instead of the generic <i>"Alexa, play news"</i>). I taught her to play videos. I even taught her to play the news in India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Canada.</p><img class="max-w-full mb-6" src="/content/assets/alexa.jpg" alt="Amazon Alexa"><p>And if you're a front-end engineer, you might've heard of the Lodash utility library. The one that has more than 28 million weekly downloads. Yeah, that one. They trusted me to bring their new <a href="https://lodash.com">documentation website</a> to life using React, Jekyll and Github Pages.</p><img class="max-w-full mb-6" src="/content/assets/lodash-page.png" alt="Lodash documentation"><p>They're still sporting my little signature at the bottom to this day. ‚ù§ you too Lodash.</p><img class="block! max-w-full mb-6 mx-auto" src="/content/assets/lodash-signature.png" alt="Lodash signature"><p>Those are some big names that put a lot of trust in me. Don't ya think?</p><p>But if I'm honest, I'm most proud of this one because of how much it impacted a cherished local business. I designed and built a new website for a local Seattle CrossFit gym. And here's what the owner had to say about the work [ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidisrael/posts/10159895346895265:0">source </a>]:</p><blockquote>Before we launched ... we were receiving about 10 new members a month at most. And 2 months after we launched our new site, our numbers had more than doubled. That math is undeniable.</blockquote><p>So no matter what kind of project you have in mind, go ahead and reach out.</p></div><div class="flex-grow order-first lg:order-none z-border-b-dashed lg:border-0 lg:px-6 mb-10"><h3 class="block font-bold text-base">Contact info</h3><p>Email:<br></p><div class="inline-flex"><span class="bg-white border border-gray-400 text-gray-800 text-sm font-display py-2 px-4 rounded-l-sm">zack@zthall.com </span><button id="copyEmailBtn" class="bg-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-400 border border-gray-400 border-l-0 text-gray-800 text-sm py-2 px-4 rounded-r-sm w-24" onclick="copyEmail()"><span id="copyIcon">üìã</span>&nbsp;<span id="copyText">Copy</span></button></div><p></p><p><span>Twitter:</span>&nbsp; <small><a href="https://twitter.com/zthall" class="z-underline">@zthall</a></small></p><p><span>Github:</span>&nbsp; <small><a href="https://github.com/zackhall" class="z-underline">@zackhall</a></small></p><p><span>LinkedIn:</span>&nbsp; <small><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hallzack/" class="z-underline">/in/hallzack</a></small></p></div></div><script>function copyEmail() {
