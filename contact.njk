      Alright, you're here. My information's right there. But you haven't
      contacted me yet. What're you waiting for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, I get it. There's a lot of engineers and you need me to
      prove that I can sling some code. I hate to be
      <strong><i>that guy</i></strong>. I don't like giving the hard sell. It's not my style, I'm
      typically more laid back. But here's a few things that I'm proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ever heard of the site
      <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>? Don't lie. I know you
      have. And if so, you've certainly been using my code. I helped build
      the navigation bar at the top of every page. And when I was on that
      team in 2016, the A/B tests we ran resulted an increase in revenue
      of more than $600M <i>per year</i>. Not bad, am I right?
    </p>

      alt="Amazon navigation"
    />
    <p>
      And you know that talking cylinder that you keep in your house?
      Yeah, she goes by Alexa usually. Ever asked her for the
      <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html">
        news
      </a>? That's running my code too. I taught Alexa many talents. I taught
      her to recognize the names of your favorite news channels (For
      example, <i>"Alexa, play news from CNN"</i> instead of the generic
      <i>"Alexa, play news"</i>). I taught her to play videos. I even
      taught her to play the news in India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
      Ireland, and Canada.
    </p>

      alt="Amazon Alexa"
    />
    <p>
      And if you're a front-end engineer, you might've heard of the Lodash
      utility library. The one that has more than 28 million weekly
      downloads. Yeah, that one. They trusted me to bring their new
      <a href="https://lodash.com">documentation website</a> to life using
      React, Jekyll and Github Pages.
    </p>
    <img
      class="max-w-full mb-6"
      src="/content/assets/lodash-page.png"
      alt="Lodash documentation"
    />
    <p>
      They're still sporting my little signature at the bottom to this
      day. ‚ù§ you too Lodash.

      class="block! max-w-full mb-6 mx-auto"

      alt="Lodash signature"
    />
    <p>
      Those are some big names that put a lot of trust in me. Don't ya
      think?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if I'm honest, I'm most proud of this one because of how much it
      impacted a cherished local business. I designed and built a new
      website for a local Seattle CrossFit gym. And here's what the owner
      had to say about the work [

    <blockquote>
      Before we launched ... we were receiving about 10 new members a
      month at most. And 2 months after we launched our new site, our
      numbers had more than doubled. That math is undeniable.

      So no matter what kind of project you have in mind, go ahead and
      reach out.
