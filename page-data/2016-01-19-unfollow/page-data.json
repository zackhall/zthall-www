In addition, it’ll show you their last tweet to help you decide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/unfollow_screenshot.png\" alt=\"Unfollow Screenshot\"></p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>I found that there was a large disconnect between the number of accounts that I was following, and the number of accounts whose content I saw weekly. I was following over 700 accounts, so there wasn’t a good way to go through and review the accounts that weren’t producing content.</p>\n<p>So I wrote a tool that allowed me to filter accounts who haven’t tweeted in a set amount of days, and make a decision if I’d like to unfollow them or not.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>You will need valid Twitter developer credentials in the form of a set of consumer and access tokens/keys. You can get these by creating a new app <a href=\"https://apps.twitter.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You must set the following environment variables from the app created in the previous step:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TWT<em>CONSUMER</em>KEY</li>\n<li>TWT<em>CONSUMER</em>SECRET</li>\n<li>TWT<em>ACCESS</em>TOKEN,</li>\n<li>TWT<em>ACCESS</em>TOKEN_SECRET</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, install the package: </p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g unfollow</code></p>\n<p>If you’d like to review the source code or contribute to the project, it’s available on <a href=\"https://github.com/zackhall/unfollow/\">github.com/zackhall/unfollow</a>.</p>\n<h2>Interesting observations</h2>\n<p>One interesting thing that I noticed with this tool is that most of the personal accounts that I’d followed, e.g. friends from high school, college, and Seattle, went inactive between 7 months to 1 year ago. Whereas, most of the accounts I follow in interest to my work and career (mostly JavaScript devs and accounts) have been very active.</p>\n<p>A sample size of one is not enough to draw conclusions on, but it certainly seems to indicate a lack of interest in using Twitter for personal accounts in my demographic.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"npm install -g unfollow","date":"January 19, 2016","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016-01-19-unfollow/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-01-19-unfollow/2016-01-19-unfollow/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"npm install -g unfollow"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-06-11-narrows-crossfit-casestudy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Narrows CrossFit: Landing Page UX Case Study"}}}}}
