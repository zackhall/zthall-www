When you buy junk though, you gain that freedom back. You can tinker. You can disassemble it to learn how it works. You can modify and tune it. And – in the worst case – if you irreparably damage it you have risked very little.</p>\n<p>That’s the positive asymmetry to junk – a lot of upside and little to lose. You can improve upon it. And through working with it, you can learn a lot.</p>\n<p>And expensive or irreplaceable items have a negative asymmetry – difficult to improve upon and a lot to lose if you make a mistake. This asymmetry can give you paralysis. And the fear of damaging the item can prevent you from trying.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>Recently, I wanted to learn how small engines work. I went on craigslist and found a guy selling two chainsaws together for $25. They were beat up, near the end of their life. And neither was running well. But I took them back and disassembled. I cleaned them out, replaced old fuel lines, replaced a couple broken pieces. In the process I also damaged them both. Beginner’s mistakes. So I ordered replacements on eBay for just a few dollars and installed them.</p>\n<p>In the end, I was never able to get one of the chainsaws running again. But the other one runs well now. I learned how the various parts of the engine work together. I learned how to adjust the throttle. I learned from my mistakes. I learned what to watch out for.</p>\n<p>But this is all possible because I started with something that had very little value to me. If I’d purchased a $300 tool instead, I would’ve never attempted a repair out of fear. Fear of exactly what did occur. Fear that I would damage it further and lose my investment. But with experience under my belt, I have a lot better understanding.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Buy Some Junk","date":"March 12, 2022","description":"Don't buy nice things.
