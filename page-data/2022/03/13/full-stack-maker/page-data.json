In the specialists category, we have front-end engineers (developers focused on the user interaction) and back-end engineers (developers focused on server logic, workflows, data storage). And we have the generalists, often referred to as “full-stack” engineers. This refers to the idea that they can work anywhere in the “stack” of various components, programming languages, tools, and applications that are used to build a system.</p>\n<p>In the last couple years, I’ve been embracing this full-stack concept beyond software. I’m aiming to become a <em>full-stack maker</em>.</p>\n<h3>What is a maker?</h3>\n<p>Adweek refers to the maker movement as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The maker movement, as we know, is the umbrella term for independent inventors, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans […] Makers tap into an American admiration for self-reliance and combine that with open-source learning, contemporary design and powerful personal technology like 3-D printers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Okay, so what’s a full-stack maker?</h3>\n<p>In software, the stack refers to a set of computer subsystems. But I’d like to think much broader than that.</p>\n<p>Roughly put, I’d like to be able to work on the full “stack” of systems needed to build modern furniture, tools, and electronics from scratch.</p>\n<p>This includes fabrication of materials – through woodworking, metal fabrication or 3d printing. This includes understanding of electronics – from building small circuits to using and programming microcontrollers like the Arduino. This includes understanding of mechanics – the ability to understand and working on mechanical parts and small engines.</p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>The ability to create – and modify – everything around you can be a sense of freedom. A freedom from being limited to what’s available on the shelf. If you want a custom piece of furniture, you can build it. If you want to modify an item to meet your needs, you can customize it.</p>\n<p>Think of the last time you spent hours shopping for something that was just right, like a specific piece of furniture. Remember the hours you spent browsing Wayfair or walking the furniture store aisles to find <em>just</em> the right piece. To find the one that fits the dimensions of your space, that has features X and Y, and that matches your design style. You end up settling for the closest option that’s available. But what if you could build it <em>exactly</em> how you picture it instead?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Full-Stack Maker","date":"March 13, 2022","description":"What's it mean to be a full-stack \"maker\"?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022/03/13/full-stack-maker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/03/12/buy-some-junk/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Buy Some Junk"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/03/14/be-prolific/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Full-Stack Maker"}}}}}
