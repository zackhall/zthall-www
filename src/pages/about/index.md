I'm a front-end engineer that builds modern interfaces with JavaScript. I grew up in Canton, OH. After high school, I went to _The_ Ohio State University (yes, we really do emphasize "[The](https://www.quora.com/Is-The-Ohio-State-University-called-THE-Ohio-State-University-outside-of-an-athletic-context)") and graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science Engineering.

I've written code for [Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011), [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/), [Lodash.com](https://lodash.com/), [Windows.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), and a slew of personal projects. I'm currently working on helping Alexa learn automatically from customer feedback.

I write about web development on the [blog](/blog) here and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZTHall).
