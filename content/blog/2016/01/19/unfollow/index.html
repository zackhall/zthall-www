In addition, it'll show you their last tweet to help you decide.</p><p><img src="./unfollow_screenshot.png" alt="Unfollow Screenshot"></p><h2 id="why" tabindex="-1">Why <a class="direct-link" href="#why" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>I found that there was a large disconnect between the number of accounts that I was following, and the number of accounts whose content I saw weekly. I was following over 700 accounts, so there wasn't a good way to go through and review the accounts that weren't producing content.</p><p>So I wrote a tool that allowed me to filter accounts who haven't tweeted in a set amount of days, and make a decision if I'd like to unfollow them or not.</p><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1">Getting started <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>You will need valid Twitter developer credentials in the form of a set of consumer and access tokens/keys. You can get these by creating a new app <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">here</a>.</p><p>You must set the following environment variables from the app created in the previous step:</p><ul><li>TWT_CONSUMER_KEY</li><li>TWT_CONSUMER_SECRET</li><li>TWT_ACCESS_TOKEN,</li><li>TWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET</li></ul><p>Now, install the package:</p><p><code>npm install -g unfollow</code></p><p>If you'd like to review the source code or contribute to the project, it's available on <a href="https://github.com/zackhall/unfollow/">github.com/zackhall/unfollow</a>.</p><h2 id="interesting-observations" tabindex="-1">Interesting observations <a class="direct-link" href="#interesting-observations" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>One interesting thing that I noticed with this tool is that most of the personal accounts that I'd followed, e.g. friends from high school, college, and Seattle, went inactive between 7 months to 1 year ago. Whereas, most of the accounts I follow in interest to my work and career (mostly JavaScript devs and accounts) have been very active.</p><p>A sample size of one is not enough to draw conclusions on, but it certainly seems to indicate a lack of interest in using Twitter for personal accounts in my demographic.</p></section></article><hr><nav><ul style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; list-style: none; padding: 0;"><li><a href="/content/blog/2015/09/26/hello/" rel="prev">← Hello</a></li><li><a href="/content/blog/2017/06/11/narrows-crossfit-casestudy/" rel="next">Narrows CrossFit: Landing Page UX Case Study →</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-green-800 text-green-200"><div class="container p-4">© 2016 Zack Hall, Proudly built in Melrose, MA.</div></footer></body></html>
