I wanted a big challenge to practice my vector illustration skills. Looking around for something to work on I glanced down at my feet and found the perfect challenge. I'll illustrate my favorite pair of kicks – my Reebok Pumps. Shoes present the perfect opportunity: complex shapes to practice pen tool skills, shading, textures.

Below are some shots from the progression to the final shot.
