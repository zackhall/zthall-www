When you buy junk though, you gain that freedom back. You can tinker. You can disassemble it to learn how it works. You can modify and tune it. And – in the worst case – if you irreparably damage it you have risked very little.</p><p>That’s the positive asymmetry to junk – a lot of upside and little to lose. You can improve upon it. And through working with it, you can learn a lot.</p><p>And expensive or irreplaceable items have a negative asymmetry – difficult to improve upon and a lot to lose if you make a mistake. This asymmetry can give you paralysis. And the fear of damaging the item can prevent you from trying.</p><h3 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example <a class="direct-link" href="#example" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Recently, I wanted to learn how small engines work. I went on craigslist and found a guy selling two chainsaws together for $25. They were beat up, near the end of their life. And neither was running well. But I took them back and disassembled. I cleaned them out, replaced old fuel lines, replaced a couple broken pieces. In the process I also damaged them both. Beginner’s mistakes. So I ordered replacements on eBay for just a few dollars and installed them.</p><p>In the end, I was never able to get one of the chainsaws running again. But the other one runs well now. I learned how the various parts of the engine work together. I learned how to adjust the throttle. I learned from my mistakes. I learned what to watch out for.</p><p>But this is all possible because I started with something that had very little value to me. If I’d purchased a $300 tool instead, I would’ve never attempted a repair out of fear. Fear of exactly what did occur. Fear that I would damage it further and lose my investment. But with experience under my belt, I have a lot better understanding.</p></section></article><hr><nav><ul style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; list-style: none; padding: 0;"><li><a href="/content/blog/2019/04/03/event-loop/" rel="prev">← 2 Conference Talks You Must Watch to Understand the JavaScript Event Loop</a></li><li><a href="/content/blog/2022/03/13/full-stack-maker/" rel="next">Full-Stack Maker →</a></li></ul></nav></main><footer class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-green-800 text-green-200"><div class="container p-4">© 2022 Zack Hall, Proudly built in Melrose, MA.</div></footer></body></html>
