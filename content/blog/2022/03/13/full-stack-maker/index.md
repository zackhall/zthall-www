  What's it mean to be a full-stack "maker"?

As in many industries, software engineers can generally fall into two broad categories: specialists vs generalists. In the specialists category, we have front-end engineers (developers focused on the user interaction) and back-end engineers (developers focused on server logic, workflows, data storage). And we have the generalists, often referred to as “full-stack” engineers. This refers to the idea that they can work anywhere in the “stack” of various components, programming languages, tools, and applications that are used to build a system.

In the last couple years, I’ve been embracing this full-stack concept beyond software. I’m aiming to become a *full-stack maker*.

### What is a maker?

Adweek refers to the maker movement as:

> The maker movement, as we know, is the umbrella term for independent inventors, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans [...] Makers tap into an American admiration for self-reliance and combine that with open-source learning, contemporary design and powerful personal technology like 3-D printers.

### Okay, so what’s a full-stack maker?

In software, the stack refers to a set of computer subsystems. But I’d like to think much broader than that.

Roughly put, I’d like to be able to work on the full “stack” of systems needed to build modern furniture, tools, and electronics from scratch.

This includes fabrication of materials – through woodworking, metal fabrication or 3d printing. This includes understanding of electronics – from building small circuits to using and programming microcontrollers like the Arduino. This includes understanding of mechanics – the ability to understand and working on mechanical parts and small engines.

### Why?

The ability to create – and modify – everything around you can be a sense of freedom. A freedom from being limited to what’s available on the shelf. If you want a custom piece of furniture, you can build it. If you want to modify an item to meet your needs, you can customize it.

Think of the last time you spent hours shopping for something that was just right, like a specific piece of furniture. Remember the hours you spent browsing Wayfair or walking the furniture store aisles to find *just* the right piece. To find the one that fits the dimensions of your space, that has features X and Y, and that matches your design style. You end up settling for the closest option that’s available. But what if you could build it *exactly* how you picture it instead?
